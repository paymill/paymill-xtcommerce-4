# PayFrame 
 
We’ve introduced a “payment form” option for easier compliance with PCI 
requirements. 
In addition to having a payment form directly integrated in your checkout page, you 
can use our embedded PayFrame solution to ensure that payment data never 
touches your website. 
 
To learn more about the benefits of PayFrame, please visit our [FAQ](https://www.paymill.com/en/faq/how-does-paymills-payframe-solution-work "FAQ").

If you select the Preauth / Capture feature, you simply have to change the status to "Capture (PAYMILL)" and a online capture will be processed.

# In case of errors

In case of any errors check the PAYMILL log entry in the plugin config and 
contact the PAYMILL support (support@paymill.de).

# Notes about the payment process

The payment is processed when an order is placed in the shop frontend.

Fast Checkout: Fast checkout can be enabled by selecting the option in the PAYMILL Basic Settings. If any customer completes a purchase while the option is active this customer will not be asked for data again. Instead a reference to the customer data will be saved allowing comfort during checkout.
